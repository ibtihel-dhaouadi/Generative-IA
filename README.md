# Exploring Generative AI 🌟  

Hi! I’m currently exploring **Generative AI** as part of my learning journey through the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera**.  
This repository documents my progress and experiments with generative models and concepts I've encountered along the way.

## 🚀 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence models that can **create new data** resembling the data they were trained on. This includes generating images, text, music, and even synthetic tabular data. As a data scientist, understanding generative models opens the door to advanced applications in data augmentation, anomaly detection, creative content generation, and more.

## 🎯 Why Generative AI Matters to Data Scientists

- Enables **data augmentation** when datasets are small or imbalanced.
- Helps build **synthetic datasets** for privacy-sensitive domains.
- Supports **unsupervised learning** and **creative applications** (like text or image generation).
- Powers innovative tools such as **chatbots**, **code assistants**, and **design generators**.

## 🧠 Models I’m Learning About

### 1. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
- GANs consist of two neural networks: a **generator** and a **discriminator**.
- The generator tries to create realistic data, while the discriminator tries to detect if the data is real or fake.
- They’re widely used for generating **realistic images**, **deepfakes**, and **data augmentation**.
- I’m especially interested in how GANs can help in **imbalanced datasets** by generating synthetic minority class examples.

### 2. VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)
- VAEs are a type of autoencoder that learns **probabilistic representations** of data.
- Unlike traditional autoencoders, they can **generate new samples** by sampling from a learned latent space.
- VAEs are useful in applications like **anomaly detection**, **recommendation systems**, and **semi-supervised learning**.


## 🛠️ What's Next?

As I progress through this course and deepen my understanding of generative models, I’ll be experimenting with simple implementations of GANs and VAEs using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. (sample notebooks and results will be added soon!)
